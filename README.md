## Introduction to Jasmine (and how to test your code)

#### Learning Objectives

  * Understand why we should test our code with specs
  * Describe what assertions and expectations are
  * Implement Jasmine with a Node application
  * Create suites of tests and individual tests

#### We ASSERT something that should match an EXPECTED value

  * Asserts are what our actual value we get.
  * They are what fails a test.
  * We *EXPECT* that an *ASSERT* matches our *EXPECTED* value
  * Let's visualize this... together.
